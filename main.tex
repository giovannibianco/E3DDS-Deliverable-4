\section{Executive Summary}
\label{exec-summ}

%\todo[inline]{Executive summary to be written at the end of the document writing process? Moved the current exec summary to introduction as that's what it was more like}

Deliverable 4: The synergies with the NeIC NT1 operations. Once decisions on the software to be deployed and run as a simulation of the \ED operations, the possibilities of inclusion to the NT1 operations are studied.The object to be delivered is a document that details the services for \ED operations and those that may or may not be managed by NeIC NT1. This includes the services and service management (e.g. FitSM) required and the division of responsibilities.  Included are estimates of the staffing required to run these services and SLAs needed. 

The study of the synergies between \ED online and NT1 operations may start once the software decisions are made in Deliverable 1 in the sixth month of the project.

The process that follows is continuous and requires input from both \ED and NT1.

Document delivered. See section 3.2.

\section{Purpose}
\label{purpose}

\subsection{Intended Audience}

The intended audience of this document is primarily NeIC and the \ED project management and staff in order to understand 

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

\input{site_services}

\section{\ED Operations}

The services shown in Table~\ref{tab:services} are those estimated, at the time of writing, to be necessary for \ED to: acquire data; process online and offline; produce data products in order to steer the radar; serve data to users for analysis.

The radar data is used to control subsequent radar transmission and receiver look directions.
Therefore the online computing services must run in real-time while the radar is transmitting.

A service that is noted as ``run by" \EC is a service that required specialized in-house knowledge that is unlikely to be found elsewhere.
The ``owned by" designation for a service refers to the management and ownership of the data in the service.
For example, the ``Site data buffer" disk array could be operated by a non-\EC entity whereas the choices on the data to retain or remove from the disks are made by \EC.
Another example could be the ``User portal web GUI" where typically operating a complex web portal is better left to experienced experts and the \EC users would access as clients where data retention etc is handled by central portal policies.

The priority of a service is defined by: {\bf 1 High:} Without this service the radar system CANNOT be run; {\bf 2 Medium:} The radar can still run but data cannot be got out of the system; {\bf 3 Low:} Radar can run and data extracted but analysis and publishing not possible.

The following scenarios for running the \ED \einfra are considered.
In these scenarios, the standard assumptions are:
\bitm
\item That the \ED data is replicated to two redundant data archives.
\item The \ED radars are planned to run 24/7~\footnote{this is a big caveat...}
\eitm

\subsection{Scenario 1}

In this scenario \EC runs all the computing on-line and off-line services noted in Table~\ref{tab:services} except for the second redundant external data archive i.e. the copy of the \ED data.

\subsubsection{Risks}

\bitm
\item Large amount of FTEs required to run all services.
\item Recruiting lots of skilled IT staff into \ESA might fail.
\item Estimate of effort? 
\eitm

\subsubsection{Benefits}
\bitm
\item Hardware and staff are controlled through one set of \EC processes.
\eitm

\subsubsection{Cost Efficiency}
\bitm
\item It may not be cost efficient for one organization to run all the services. Finding people with enough skills to run and maintain a wide variety of services usually difficult.
\item Replication of already existing services e.g. EGI Checkin.
\eitm

\subsubsection{Reliability}
\bitm
\item Reliability might suffer if enough people are not able to be hired to cover for holidays/sickness/job changes.
\eitm

\subsubsection{User Satisfaction}
\bitm
\item User satisfaction may be high as users are able to contact directly to \EC personnel for help with problems or questions.
\item User satisfaction might be negatively impacted by a learning period for how to run many new services.
\eitm


\subsection{Scenario 2}
\label{ssec:scen2}

The NeIC NT1 programme runs all computing except the \ED inventory system and FSRUs under a service contract.

Risks and benefits roughly the same.

Recruiting easier.

Cost benefits the same.

Some services not suited to be run by NT1. Replicating services.

Boundaries would have to be very tightly defined. SLAs.

RBBF nodes... also tricky to run. Custom build of nodes. Tuning.

Internal metadata catalogue?

Experiment database... boundaries? Tricky boundary conditions... SLAs. Agents that program the FSRUs will pull data.

\eitm
\subsection{Scenario 3}
\label{ssec:scen3}

EISCAT runs high, outsources medium/low to partners (Dirac at STFC, data staging and data archive at NT1, batch compute at HPC2N, metadata catalog at CSC, software management at UiT, etc).

\subsection{Scenario 4}
\label{ssec:scen4}

EISCAT runs most, but outsources things with obvious synergies at other places (data archive, batch computing, web portals).
Other places... NT1 and other partners.

User Portal (with someone already running DIRAC for other communities)

Identity management (EGI/INFN/etc that handles federated identities)

User Compute (with someone that runs large batch computing)

User software deployment (with someone that runs scientific computing)

Data Archive, Data Staging, and Site Data Buffer could be synergistically run as one storage (NT1)

Data product repository and publishing

File catalog (with someone that is already running Rucio)

\subsection{Scenario 5}
\label{ssec:scen5}

Like Section~\ref{ssec:scen3} but NT1 operates EISCAT's inhouse resources under a service contract.

How is this different to 2? ... EISCAT outsources low and medium to partners. High is operated by NT1 on under a service contract.

\subsection{Scenario 6}
\label{ssec:scen6}

Like Section~\ref{ssec:scen4} but NT1 operates EISCAT's inhouse resources under a service contract.

NT1 would operate the services that do not have obvious synergy with the EISCAT ``partners".
